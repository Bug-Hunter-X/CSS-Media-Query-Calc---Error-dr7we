The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of `calc()` within a `@media` query:

```css
@media (max-width: calc(100vw - 100px)) {
  .element {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

This code attempts to use `calc()` to dynamically calculate the maximum width based on the viewport width. However, this will not work as expected in many browsers, because `calc()` is not directly supported within media query conditions. The calculation should be done outside the `@media` rule.
